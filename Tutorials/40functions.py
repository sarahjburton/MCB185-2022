# A function is created with the def keyword, a name, and a colon
# All of the statements in a function are indented
# Functions are generally declared at the top of the file
# In this tutorial, they are spread throughout the file

	print('hello')

greeting()

	print(f'hello {person}')

# ------------------------ Floating Point Math Warning ------------------------

# Numbers in a computer aren't always what they appear

h1 = [0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1]
h2 = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]
s1 = sum(h1)
s2 = sum(h2)
if s1 != s2: print(f'oh no: {s1} {s2}')

# You can use == when comparing integers, but
# NEVER use == when dealing with floating point numbers!
# Instead, ask if the difference between them is small

if math.isclose(s1, s2): print('good enough')
if math.isclose(1.0, 1.1): print('not good enough')

# You can choose your own tolerance between the numbers if you like

if math.isclose(1.0, 1.0, abs_tol=0.01): print('acceptable')


# -------------------------------- Assertions ---------------------------------

# The assert() function is useful for debugging
# It demands that something is true or kills the program
# Last lesson, you made an entropy calculator
# Here's how to make it into a function
# Note the use of assert() and math.isclose()

def entropy(p):
	assert(math.isclose(sum(p), 1.0))
	h = 0
	for v in p:
		h -= v * math.log2(v)
	return h

print(entropy(h1))
#print(entropy([0.2, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4])) # remove comment to observe error


# ------------------------- Advanced Function Syntax --------------------------

# The content below is considered OPTIONAL
# You don't need to program using advanced function syntax
# However, you will run into these concepts, so it's good to know about them


# ----------------------------- Named Parameters ------------------------------

# Functions usually have a fixed number of positional arguments
# But they may also take named arguments
# For example, you have seen this with print() statements

for c in 'acgt':
	print(c, end='-') # prints - instead of finishing line
print() # prints blank line at the end

# Your functions can also have named parameters

def get_codons(seq, frame=0):
	codons = []
	for i in range(frame, len(seq) - 2, 3):
		codons.append(seq[i:i+3])
	return codons

tx = 'ATGCGATAGATACCAGATATAT'
print(get_codons(tx))           # no frame, assumed to be 0
print(get_codons(tx, frame=1))  # use named parameter


# ---------------------------- Variable Parameters ----------------------------

# Functions can take a variable number of parameters

def squares(*values):
	squared = []
	for v in values: squared.append(v * v)
	return squared

print(squares(1))
print(squares(1, 2, 0.5))

# You can even mix variable parameters and named parameters

def pow(*values, power=2):
	results = []
	for v in values: results.append(v ** power)
	return results

print(pow(1, 2, 0.5))
print(pow(1, 2, 0.5, power=3))

# You can even have variable named parameters...
# But not today


# ---------------------------- Generator Functions ----------------------------

# There are times when you want to generate a list of data
# Here's a function that returns a list of random sequences

def randseq(count, length):
	seqs = []
	for i in range(count):
		seq = []
		for j in range(length):
			seq.append(random.choice('ACGT'))
		seqs.append(''.join(seq))
	return seqs

seqs = randseq(5, 7)
print(seqs)

# A list of a few sequences isn't a big deal
# But imagine we want a function to create many large sequences
# The following code may cause your computer to run out of memory!
# Kill it with control-C and comment it out!

seqs = randseq(3000, 1000000) # size of human genome in 1M chunks

# Holding all of those sequences in memory is a lot of work
# Instead of creating all sequences up-front, generate them as needed
# Any function with a 'yield' statement is a generator function
# A 'yield' temporarily stops execution to return value(s)
# Generators improve performance by reducing memory

def seqgen(count, length):
	for i in range(count):
		seq = []
		for j in range(length):
			seq.append(random.choice('ACGT'))
		yield ''.join(seq)

# This works, but it takes a long time to run
# So ^C it and comment it out after trying it

for seq in seqgen(3000, 1000000): print(seq)

# In addition to generator functions, there are generator expressions
# These look a lot like list comprehension
# Except with parentheses instead of square brackets
# This is doubly optional

for r in (random.random() for i in range(10)):
	print(r)
